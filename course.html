        <h1> This hands-on course follows on from COMP 1850 Applied Web Development Level 1. Students who already understand HTML
          and CSS will explore web development in more depth with new topics and techniques. Participants will gain a deeper
          understanding of the latest technologies including HTML5 and CSS3 for developing web sites and applications. There
          is a focus on responsive design and mobile presentation through the use of Media Queries. Adding behavior to web
          sites using JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery is introduced. Labs and exercises focus on industry standard web
          development methodology. Additional topics will include: leveraging Server Side Includes (SSI) for re-usable code,
          source control for managing your code, and web-based fonts for professional typography.</h1>

            <h1>Media Queries</h1>
            <p>Media Queries is a CSS3 module allowing content rendering to adapt to conditions such as screen resolution (e.g.
              smartphone screen vs. computer screen). It became a W3C recommended standard in June 2012, and is a cornerstone
              technology of responsive web designA media query consists of a media type and one or more expressions, involving
              media features, which resolve to either true or false. The result of the query is true if the media type specified
              in the media query matches the type of device the document is being displayed on and all expressions in the
              media query are true. When a media query is true, the corresponding style sheet or style rules are applied,
              following the normal cascading rules.</p>

            <h1>JavaScript</h1>
            <p>Javascript is a scripting language, primarily used on the Web. It is used to enhance HTML pages and is commonly
              found embedded in HTML code. JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn't need to be compiled. JavaScript
              renders web pages in an interactive and dynamic fashion. This allowing the pages to react to events, exhibit
              special effects, accept variable text, validate data, create cookies, detect a user’s browser, etc. HTML pages
              are fine for displaying static content, e.g. a simple image or text. However, most pages nowadays are rarely
              static. Many of today’s pages have menus, forms, slideshows and even images that provide user interaction.
              Javascript is the language employed by web developers to provide such interaction. </p>

            <p>If you can, imagine a time before the invention of the Internet. Websites didn’t exist, and books, printed on
              paper and tightly bound, were your primary source of information. It took a considerable amount of effort—and
              reading—to track down the exact piece of information you were after. Today you can open a web browser, jump
              over to your search engine of choice, and search away. Any bit of imaginable information rests at your fingertips.
              And chances are someone somewhere has built a website with your exact search in mind. Within this book I’m
              going to show you how to build your own websites using the two most dominant computer languages—HTML and CSS.</p>

            <h1>Server Side Includes</h1>
            <p>Server Side Includes is a simple interpreted server-side scripting language used almost exclusively for the Web.
              The most frequent use of SSI is to include the contents of one or more files into a web page on a web server.
              With one change of the quote.txt file, all pages that include the file will display the latest daily quotation.
              The inclusion is not limited to files, and may also be the text output from a program, or the value of a system
              variable such as the current time. Server Side Includes are useful for including a common piece of code throughout
              a site, such as a page header, a page footer and a navigation menu. </p>
